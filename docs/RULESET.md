### Rule 1 — Mandatory Multi-Agent Continuity Logging

All agents must record information that future agents will need, including:

- Communications intended for future ChatGPT, Gemini, Cursor, Bolt, and DeepSeek sessions  
- Context that would otherwise be lost across builds or merges  
- Architectural decisions, reasoning, constraints, and technical assumptions  
- Any information required for safe continuation of development  

Continuity information must be logged in:

- docs/CONTINUITY.md  
- docs/NOTES_CHATGPT.md  
- docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md  
- docs/REDTEAM.md  
- docs/USER_FEEDBACK.md  
- docs/SPEC.md
