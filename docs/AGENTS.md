## 7. Continuity Logging Requirement

Every agent must document:

- Reasoning behind decisions  
- Clarifications obtained from ChatGPT or DeepSeek  
- Observations important for future sessions  
- Any information that might otherwise be lost  

Continuity logs should be recorded in:

- docs/CONTINUITY.md  
- docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md  
- docs/NOTES_CHATGPT.md  
- docs/REDTEAM.md  
- docs/USER_FEEDBACK.md  
- docs/SPEC.md  

## 8. Required Reading Order  
(See CONTINUITY.md for mandatory reading sequence before contributing.)
