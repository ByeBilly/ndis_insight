ChatGPT will log:

- design intent  
- constraints  
- architectural warnings  
- long-term plans  
- communications meant for future ChatGPT sessions  
- cross-session context that may otherwise be lost  
- development continuity notes important for other agents  
- assumptions or constraints that should persist across builds  
- context that may be lost between builds, merges, or session resets
